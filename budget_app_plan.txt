Running Local PosgreSQL
set env var PGDATA=/usr/local/var/postgres
run postgers server with the command `postgres`
run cli command createdb <dbname>
connect with psql <dbname> (hiro_psql_local)


EC2 Setup
need to run the following command to install psychopg2
	`sudo yum -y install gcc python-setuptools python-devel postgresql-devel`
	(I'm not sure if this did anythin)
	`/usr/local/bin/pip install -r ...`
	(for some reason `pip install` did not do it)

Env vars are in envs file

nohup python main.py
	nohup let you run a file after exiting ssh or bash


Email reader
	first get the server running so that auth request can be made from localhost
	can use tools.run_flow so that we don't need server maybe
	
	install google python sdk 
	get credential from home mac
		make sure to set 'access_type' 'offline'
	Follow this link on OAuth for Web apps
		https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/auth/web-app
	store credential in db as json
	probably don't have to use Storage: just use OAuth2Credentials.from_json()
